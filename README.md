Quiz 2:

$ python3 quiz_2.py
Enter three nonnegative integers: 0 3 8
Here is the mapping that has been generated:
0 -> 1
1 -> 1
1 -> 2
1 -> 0
1 -> 2
1 -> 0
1 -> 1
2 -> 0
Sorry, that's not a correct mapping.

$ python3 quiz_2.py
Enter three nonnegative integers: 1 10 4
Here is the mapping that has been generated:
1 -> 1
2 -> 7
4 -> 7
9 -> 7
Ok, that's a correct mapping.
The list of most frequent inputs is:
[1, 2, 4, 9]
The function extracted from the mapping is:
{1: 1, 2: 7, 4: 7, 9: 7}

$ python3 quiz_2.py
Enter three nonnegative integers: 2 8 6
Here is the mapping that has been generated:
0 -> 4
1 -> 3
1 -> 0
2 -> 2
4 -> 6
5 -> 6
Ok, that's a correct mapping.
The list of most frequent inputs is:
[1]
The function extracted from the mapping is:
{0: 4, 2: 2, 4: 6, 5: 6}

$ python3 quiz_2.py
Enter three nonnegative : 3 20 15
Here is the mapping that has been generated:
0 -> 6
2 -> 15
4 -> 17
7 -> 17
7 -> 15
8 -> 12
11 -> 4
15 -> 7
15 -> 4
17 -> 16
17 -> 12
18 -> 0
18 -> 2
19 -> 5
19 -> 18
Ok, that's a correct mapping.
The list of most frequent inputs is:
[7, 15, 17, 18, 19]
The function extracted from the mapping is:
{0: 6, 2: 15, 4: 17, 8: 12, 11: 4}

$ python3 quiz_2.py
Enter three nonnegative integers: 4 8 10
Here is the mapping that has been generated:
0 -> 4
1 -> 0
1 -> 3
1 -> 5
2 -> 4
3 -> 2
4 -> 1
6 -> 4
6 -> 3
7 -> 0
Ok, that's a correct mapping.
The list of most frequent inputs is:
[1]
The function extracted from the mapping is:
{0: 4, 2: 4, 3: 2, 4: 1, 7: 0}
